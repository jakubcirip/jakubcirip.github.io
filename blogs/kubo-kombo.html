        <h2>Motivation and Idea</h2>
        <p>First of all, I would like to offer you an insight into what motivated me for this project.</p>
        <p>Why would someone want a guitar combo?<br>
          The answer is simple, they want to play their guitar with a decent sound.<br>
          But why not just buy one, but make one? - I like to make simple things more complicated;)<br>
          The basic idea was to use 2 45W speakers that I had left over from the original setup.<br><br>
          In the next section we will see the assembly of components for the project</p>
