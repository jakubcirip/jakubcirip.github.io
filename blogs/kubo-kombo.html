                <h1>Welcome!</h1>
                <p>I'm thrilled that you want to learn more about this project. <br>

                <h3>Motivation and Idea</h3>
                <p>First of all, I would like to offer you an insight into what motivated me for this project.</p>
                <p>Why would someone want a guitar combo?<br>
                    The answer is simple, they want to play their guitar with a decent sound.<br>
                    But why not just buy one, but make one? - I like to make simple things more complicated;)<br>
                    The basic idea was to use 2 45W speakers that I had left over from the original setup.<br><br>
                    In the next section we will see the assembly of components for the project. <br><br></p>

                <h3>List of compoments</h3>
                <p>

                    <li>2x 45W 8Ω reproductors</li>

                <h3>Combo Design - proposal and solution</h3>
                <p>The dimensions must be designed so that all the modules of the combo are placed inside it and are
                    easily accessible for assembly and serviceability.<br>

                <div class="blog-media">
                    <div class="blog-media__text">
                        <p>
                            The dimensions of the box are: <br>
                            420 x 320 x 230 <br>
                            The 420 width is sufficient to comfortably place two 185 diameter speakers side by side.
                            <br>
                            In the middle of the box and on the sides I designed various points for attaching all the
                            components and
                            modules.

                <h4>Proposal of the inner wall</h4>
                <p>For better sound properties, my friend, an expert in the field of audio equipment, recommended that I
                    insert an inner wall that will separate the speakers from the electrical equipment and at the same
                    time place damping material on it (on the side near the speakers) so that the sound spreads better
                    outwards from the combo. <br>
                    This wall will also be useful for placing electrical component (preamps, buffers, aplifier and DC
                    conventor). <br> <br>
                    In the next picture you can see how it looks inside with this wall (without all components).<br>

                <h3>JFET Buffer</h3><br>
                <h4>Impedance Buffer</h4>
                <p>
                    A buffer is a circuit that isolates one part of a system from another, often acting as a bridge
                    between a high impedance source and a low impedance load.<br>
                    It ensures signal integrity by preventing loading, distortion, or signal loss, while usually
                    providing current gain.<br>
                    For the purpose of our combo, it separates the guitar from the preamp module, providing a high input
                    impedance at the input of the preamp module.
                </p><br>
                <h4>Main Characteristic of JFET buffer:</h4>
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc; padding-left: 1rem; list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li>It preserved the signal from the guitar without losing quality. It shapes the tone without
                        change.</li>
                    <li>Matches the impedance of the guitar and the preamp input.</li>
                    <li>Amplifies current, not voltage.</li>
                    <li>Separates the guitar from the preamp – the preamp circuit does not affect the guitar pickup.
                    </li>
                    <li>Preserves the dynamics and natural tone of the guitar.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <h4>Buffer manufacturing</h4>
                <p>
                    Buffer components: J201 transistor, 2x capacitor, 3x resistor, PCB board <br>
                </p><br>
                <h4>Buffer Scheme</h4>
                <p>In this phase, the first step was design of buffer and scheme drawing. The testing program also
                    helped me with simulation odf buffer and measurement the values of voltige. For JFET 'follower'
                    beffer is really important to set up the right operating point of JFET transistor.<br>
                    The DC operating point is the voltage and current in transistor without input signal.<br>
                    It defines transistor behaviour during signal processing.<br>
                    If the operating point is set up incorrectly it can cause, <br> that transistor will be 'close' ->
                    means doesn't work, <br> or will be overloaded -> which leads to signal distortion, noise or
                    overheating<br> On the first picture we can see the simple buffer with voltage divider for
                    transistor Gate (this voltage help us to set the right operating point). The buffer is without input
                    and output signals and capacitors.</p>

                <p>On the second picture I added an input source (AC) (which represents the source from the guitar)
                    trought a 1uF input capacitor and an output signal from a transistor Source going trought 4,7uF
                    output capacitor. Using simulation mode we can see the voltage readings on the voltmeters.</p>
